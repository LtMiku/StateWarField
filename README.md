# State War Field
State War Field was made back in 2013 by Shady, Jake and Fercorpro. The script was in beta progress, however some bugs were fixed by Shady and Jake. This script is outdated, so I don't recommend using it unless you're a guy who knows how does the non-threaded MySQL version works. You are free to use it and make your own server with it, but make sure not to remove the credits. I am using Apache License, so if you took off the credits - then, your server will be shutted down.
