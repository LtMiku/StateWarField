# State War Field
State War Field was an alternate team deathmatch server, belonging to the original International Roleplay in San Andreas Multiplayer in 2012 by Shady (me), JaKe Elite, and FERCORPRO. The script took 6 months in-order to develop it, however, we decided to discontinue the project due to our main focus in International Roleplay.

# More Information
This is the latest beta version but it was unfinished with missing features and outdated plugins & includes. I do not recommend anyone to use it unless you are an advanced SA-MP Scripter who can rewrite, upgrade, and fix it. The script is free to use it as long as you do not remove credits from the game mode and claim it as yours.
